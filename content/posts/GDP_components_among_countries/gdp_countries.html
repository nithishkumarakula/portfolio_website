<p>Let’s look at the GDP data from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts
Main Aggregates Database</a>,
which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all
countries from 1970 to today. At the risk of oversimplifying things, the
main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption
(C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports
(exports - imports).</p>
<p>We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and
compare different countries and how much each component contributes to
that country’s GDP.</p>
<p>First Let’s load the data and tidy it. Let’s compare the GDP changes for
United States, Germany and India.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s see how each GDP components has changed for these 3
countries since 1970.</p>

<p>Now, let’s compare the GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in
US Dollars for United States, India and Germany.</p>

<p>These are our observations from keenly observing these graphs for United
States, Germany and India.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In Germany, the only GDP component that has been growing for the
past 20 years is net exports. This indicates that German economic
growth is fueled by exporting more than importing. Government
expenditure is relatively stable. This indicates that the government
isn’t investing heavily in the moment, which is sadly true and which
explains why Germany is very backward in terms of internet access
and future technology adoption (like 5G networks). Gross capital
formation (also called “investment”) has been going down lightly for
the past 50 years, indicating that German businesses don’t invest as
heavily as they used to. Relative German household expenditure has
been stable. This makes sense when considering that the German
population isn’t growing, it is rather shrinking and only an
immigration influx has been stablilizing it.</p></li>
<li><p>The chart looks very different for India. There, relative household
expenditure has dropped from around 70% in 1970 to around 55%. In
the same time period, gross capital formation has been going up by
15%. This indicates that Indian companies are investing heavily at
the moment. Furthermore, government expenditure has been mostly
stable at around 10%, which is half as much as Germany. The
frugality of the Indian government probably stems from the fact that
India is not yet as highly developed as Germany. Interestingly, net
exports has been mostly negative in the past 50 years. This
indicates that India is reliant on imports from other countries
because they import more than they export.</p></li>
<li><p>In the US, the component that is growing the most is household
expenditure, now at about 70%. In Germany, this is currently only
55%. This indicates that the US economy focuses more on producing
for their own population compared to Germany focusing a bit more on
exporting goods. This makes sense as the US market is extremely
strong. In addition, the US have negative net exports, currently at
around -5%. Relative government expenditure has been decreasing,
from around 25% in 1970 to around 15% in 2016. In Germany, this
value is at around 20% in 2016. This indicates that the US isn’t
investing heavily at the moment, growth rather stems from household
expenditure.</p></li>
